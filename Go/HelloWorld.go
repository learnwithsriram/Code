// Main Package
package main

//Typical Import Statement With Different Syntax
import (
	"fmt" //this pacakge has formatting functions
)

//main is the execution point for our go program
func main() {
	fmt.Println("hello World") //prints "Hello World" message to the console. 
}

/* If you have written "C" program apart from package and import statement, nothing much has changed. 
GO is a language that is created with "C" language as an inspiration.
